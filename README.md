# MACHINE LEARNING AND PATTERN RECOGNITION
#### Project task
## Lab 2
The project task consists of a binary classiﬁcation problem. The goal is to perform ﬁngerprint spooﬁng detection, i.e. to identify genuine vs counterfeit ﬁngerprint images. The dataset consists of labelled samples corresponding to the genuine (True, label 1) class and the fake (False, label 0) class. The samples are computed by a feature extractor that summarizes high-level characteristics of a ﬁngerprint image. The data is 6-dimensional.
The training ﬁles for the project are stored in ﬁle Project/trainData.txt. The format of the ﬁle is the same as for the Iris dataset, i.e. a csv ﬁle where each row represents a sample. The ﬁrst 6 values of each row are the features, whereas the last value of each row represents the class (1 or 0). The samples are not ordered. 
Load the dataset and plot the histogram and pair-wise scatter plots of the diﬀerent features. Analyze the plots:
1.	Analyze the ﬁrst two features. What do you observe? Do the classes overlap? If so, where? Do the classes show similar mean for the ﬁrst two features? Are the variances similar for the two classes? How many modes are evident from the histograms (i.e., how many “peaks” can be observed)?
2.	Analyze the third and fourth features. What do you observe? Do the classes overlap? If so, where? Do the classes show similar mean for these two features? Are the variances similar for the two classes? How many modes are evident from the histograms?
3.	Analyze the last two features. What do you observe? Do the classes overlap? If so, where? How many modes are evident from the histograms? How many clusters can you notice from the scatter plots for each class?
